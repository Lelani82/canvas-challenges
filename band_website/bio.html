    <h1>Nirvana</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. It was founded by lead singer 
        and guitarist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the 
        longest-lasting and best-known being Dave Grohl, who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 
        after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern 
        rock and roll culture.
