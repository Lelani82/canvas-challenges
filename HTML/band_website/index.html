        <p>
            Nirvana was an American rock band formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987. It was founded by lead singer 
            and guitarist <a href="bio.html">Kurt Cobain</a> and bassist <a href="bio.html">Krist Novoselic</a>. Nirvana went through a succession of drummers, the longest-lasting and best-known being <a href="bio.html">Dave Grohl</a>, who joined in 1990. Though the band dissolved in 1994 after the death of Cobain, their music maintains a popular following and continues to influence modern 
            rock and roll culture.
